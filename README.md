# Utility DCTLS
These are DCTLs that I have developed.


# Installation
DCTLs should be placed in the following folder:

**MacOS**: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/LUT`

**Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\LUT`

Fuses should be placed in the following folder to install them into the Fusion page of DaVinci Resolve:

**MacOS**: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Fuses`

**Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Fuses`

Fuses should also be placed in the following folder to install them for Fusion Studio:

**MacOS**: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/Fusion/Fuses`

**Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\Fusion\Fuses`

If a DCTL is not working, you can usually find logs in these directories. If you find that there is a problem, make an Issue on Github with your OS and Resolve version so I can fix it.

**MacOS (Apple Silicon)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/logs/davinci_resolve.log`

**MacOS (Intel)**: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/logs/davinci_resolve.log`

**Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\logs\davinci_resolve.log`

# The Fuses

## MTF Curve Fuse
This is a higher quality version of the MTF Curve DCTL. Here, we provide 5 frequency bands in which the lower end number of line-pairs per mm can be specified, and the computation of the frequency bands is done in a higher quality way. Importantly, this Fuse requires that your input image is a Float16 or Float32 type image, and it works best on a Log state image. I do not recommend using it with a Linear state image, and I would also recommend clamping the input to be non-negative. This Fuse works using several different discrete frequency bands rather than via a fourier transform, but it largely gives good looking results regardless.

### Parameters
**Gate Width**: The mm width of your frame.

**Band 1-5 LP/mm**: This indicates where the frequency band should start for bands 1-5. Technically the resizing operation is imperfect, so if you're trying to match a chart, lower each value slightly. IE if you have a chart with 20 LP/mm on it, set the band to start early at about 5 LP/mm below the value you're trying to target.

**Band 1-5 Contrast**: This allows you to control the contrast level of each band on a scale from 0 to 2. 1.0 is neutral, and higher is more contrast.

**Debug Mode**: This pull-down allows you to figure out what each band targets. You can choose from None (runs the plugin normally), Low Pass Mode (shows you the information that's too low frequency to be captured in this band), High Pass Mode (shows the information that's in this band), and High Pass Gray Mode (Same as High Pass mode, but normalized to 0.5 so that the frequency data in this band is more visible).

**Debug Band**: Allows you to choose which band will be shown in the Debug mode.

**Performance Mode**: Quality does the right thing, but if you find that it's too slow, you can change this to Performance. Performance uses a lower quality computation for the low frequency information, and importantly it disables all bands except for the last two.

**Method**: Choose between Quotient and Difference. In most real-world scenarios, the Quotient method provides better looking results, but the Difference method performs more accurately on zebra striped test charts. Here's the math:
```
quotient_out := (input_value / low_pass5)^band5_contrast * (low_pass5 / low_pass4)^band4_contrast * ... * low_pass1
difference_out := (input_value - low_pass5)*band5_contrast + (low_pass5 - low_pass4)*band4_contrast + ... + low_pass1
```

## Linear Exposure Fuse
Simply multiplies the input values by `2^x`, where `x` is the specified Exposure (Stops) value. Expects a Linear input.

### Parameters
**Exposure (Stops)**: Exposure compensation to make in stops.

# The DCTLs:

## ACES Exposure DCTL
DCTL that allows for adjustment of exposure in ACES. Important: It's probably better to just set your timeline color space to the ACES color space you want to use, and then to use the Exposure slider in the HDR color wheels.

### How it works
Internally, this DCTL converts ACEScc or ACEScct to Linear, and then applies a gain according to the specified exposure adjustment before converting the image back into the original color space.

### DCTL Parameters
**ACES Gamma**: Pulldown menu in which you select from ACES (Linear), ACEScc, and ACEScct. This is where you specify the gamma of the image that is being fed into this DCTL.

**Exposure Adjustment**: Specifies the number of stops to increase or decrease (negative) exposure.


## Addition Function DCTL
Adds a value to each channel. The channels are computed by $\text{Red}_{\text{out}} = \text{Red}_{\text{in}} + \text{Global Offset} + \text{Red Offset}$ and likewise for the other two channels.


## Blanking Checker DCTL
Helps you spot pixels with NaN, infinity, negative, zero, or superwhite channels. Pixels with certain conditions are replaced by a specified highlight color. Optionally, the highlight can be a checkerboard shape.

### DCTL Parameters
**Highlight Color Red**: Red component of the highlight color.

**Highlight Color Green**: Green component of the highlight color.

**Highlight Color Blue**: Blue component of the highlight color.

**Checkerboard Size**: Square size of the generated checkerboard, if set to zero, just uses the Highlight Color.

**Highlight NaNs**: Highlights pixels with a NaN channel.

**Highlight -Inf**: Highlights pixels with -infinity as at least one channel

**Highlight < 0.0**: Highlights pixels with negative real values.

**Highlight == 0.0**: Highlights pixels that have a channel equal to zero.

**Highlight == 1.0**: Highlights pixels that have a channel equal to 1.0.

**Highlight > 1.0**: Highlights pixels that have a channel that exceeds 1.0.

**Highlight +Inf**: Highlights pixels with +infinity as at least one channel.


## Bleach Bypass DCTL
Applies a beach bypass look to the image. Expects a Linear image. Uses a custom Overlay implementation designed for Linear images.

### DCTL Parameters
**Saturation**: Indicates how saturated or desaturated the result should be.

**Gamma**: Controls the contrast of the image.

**Middle Gray**: Indicates the middle gray value that will be preserved.


## Clamp DCTL
Clamps the code values of the current frame to the specified Min and Max values, such that for any `x`, we will then have `clamp_min <= x <= clamp_max`

### DCTL Parameters
**Min Clamp**: Specifies the value at which we will set `x = max(x, Min Clamp)`

**Max Clamp**: Specifies the value at which we will set `x = min(x, Max Clamp)`

**Clamp Min (Checkbox)**: Uncheck to bypass the Min Clamping step.

**Clamp Max (Checkbox)**: Uncheck to bypass the Max Clamping step.


## ColorChecker DCTL
Generates a colorchecker image based on the original specification (you can find in Documentation/ColorChecker.pdf). Outputs in XYZ/Linear color space.

### DCTL Parameters
**Exposure Adjustment**: Stops of exposure adjustment, in case the rendered image isn't your preferred brightness.

**Outer Border Width**: How much black border to draw around the whole image.

**Inner Border Width**: How much black border to draw around individual chips.

**Convert Illuminant C to D65**: The xyY values used are copied from the spec, which assumed the Standard Illuminant C illuminant. As most electronics use a D65 illuminant, check this box to use a bradford chromatic adaptation matrix to best approximate what the chart would look like under a D65 illuminant.



## Color Ramp DCTL
Creates a color ramp from 0 to 100% Hue, Saturation, or Luminance. This can be used to monitor the output of your tools and overall node pipeline.

### DCTL Parameters
**Ramp Type**: Choose from Luminance, Saturation, or Hue ramp.

**Saturation Ramp Hue**: If Saturation ramp is selected, then this controls the hue of the ramp.

**Hue Ramp Saturation**: If Hue ramp is selected, then this controls the saturation of the hue ramp.


## Cube Rotate DCTL
Takes the specified vector and rotates the RGB cube (around 0,0,0) so that the given vector is now achromatic.

### DCTL Parameters
**Color R, Color G, Color B**: The RGB components of the vector that will be rotated gray.

**Inverse**: Rotates the cube the opposite angle, so that the currently white vector rotates to the direction of the specified vector, therefore doing the opposite of the normal version.


## Dot Product DCTL
Takes the dot product of the current color and the specified `(r, g, b)` value.


## Exposure Chart DCTL
Creates a middle gray exposure chart, an exponential ramp, a linear ramp, and several gray exposure chips that are an integer number of stops above and below middle gray. This is intended to be used in a linear gamma timeline.

### DCTL Parameters
**Number of Steps**: Specifies the number of exposure chips to be displayed in the chart. One of the ones in the middle will share its value with middle gray, and each chip to the right will have a code value double of the previous chip.

**Middle Gray Value**: Specifies the desired value of middle gray, which is 18% by default. This controls the brightness of the large chip in the middle too.



## False Color Generator
Generates a false color conversion for linear images. Draws middle gray at the specified value and sets a gray color for the values +/- half a stop from middle gray. Then, chooses random colors for each further stop. This allows you to measure contrast ratios in-camera.

### DCTL Parameters
**Middle Gray Value**: Middle gray value, 18% by default.

**Color Chip Exposure**: Raises or lowers the exposure of the drawn color chips to make them more or less visible.

**Number of Steps**: Number of steps to convert to false color. Values outside this range will just be passed through.

**Seed**: Specifies the random seed used to generate colors


## Film Curve DCTL
Assumes the scene is a linear image, then converts to log10 exposure values, applies a sigmoid characteristic curve to get density, then computes transmittance. Parametric over each of the three channels.

In practice, you should use the following pipeline: `1. Clamp 0+ ==> 2. Film Curve (to simulate the negative) ==> 3. Color Gain ==> 4. Film Curve (to simulate the print) ==> 5. Gain (if you want white to not be 100%) ==> 6. Display Encoding`. (3) represents your printer lights and should make it so that middle gray is preserved at 0.18 from (1) to (4).

### DCTL Parameters
**Red/Green/Blue Gamma**: Film gamma for each channel.

**Red/Green/Blue D_MIN**: Minimum density for each channel.

**Red/Green/Blue D_MAX**: Maximum density for each channel.

**Red/Green/Blue Offset**: indicates how far to the left to move each characteristic curve in the Density vs Log10 Exposure chart.

**Mid Gray**: Indicates the mid gray value in the input image.

**Exposure Gain**: Increase or decrease the incoming exposure.

**Linear to Exposure**: Check to apply the Exposure Gain to convert from scene illuminance to Exposure value

**Exposure to Log10 Exposure**: Check to apply a Log10 Function to the Exposure value

**Characteristic Curve**: Check to apply the Sigmoid that converts from Log10 Exposure to Density

**Density to Transmittance**: Check to convert computed Density to Transmittance.

**Draw Characteristic Curve**: Draws the characteristic curve on-screen. The fat line in the middle is Lux-Seconds = 0.0, each vertical line is 1.0 Log10 exposure. The horizontal lines represent density in 1.0 increments.

**Curve Type**: allows you to use Sigmoid of "Quadratic Sigmoid", which follows a similar shape but has a more a brupt rolloff.



## Gamma Function
Applies a power function with the reciprocal of the specified exponent.

### DCTL Parmaeters
**Gamma**: Given some number $\gamma$, raise each of the RGB components to the power of $\gamma$

**Use Reciprocal**: If checked, instead raises each RGB component to the power of $1 / \gamma$.

**Negative Values**: For a negative input color component $x$, choose from:
* Clip 0 - returns $y = 0$
* y=x - Returns $y = x$
* y=x/gamma - Returns $y = x / \gamma$ so the slope somewhat scales according to the choice of exponent.
* Positive Reflection - Returns $y = \lvert x \rvert^\gamma$
* Sign Match Reflection - Returns $y = -\lvert x \rvert^\gamma$, returning a negative result if $x$ is negative.


## Halation DCTL
DCTL that physically emulates film halation, intended for ACES Linear AP0 images. This is intended to be used in a linear gamma timeline.

### How Halation works
Light passes through three layers of film emulsion and various color filters, ultimately with the bottom channel being Red. Light then passes through the film base and reflects off the back of the film, and this red light then re-exposes the channels in reverse order (red, then green, then blue).

### DCTL Parameters
**Focal Length** (mm): The focal length of the lens used

**Film Base Thickness** (mm): The thickness of the film (most films are between 0.12 and 0.20 mm thick). This is used in conjunction with the focal length to determine how much larger the reflected image is than the original image. Set the film thickness to zero to remove any scaling.

**Reflection exposure lost** (stops): As light passes through the film base and reflects off the anti-halation layer, it loses brightness. This parameter controls how many stops of light are lost by the time the reflection reaches the red channel again on the rebound.

**Green exposure lost** (stops): Controls how much light is lost when the reflected light passes through the red channel and then exposes the green channel. This is added to the Reflection exposure lost.

**Blue exposure lost** (stops): Controls how much light is lost when the reflected light passes through the green channel and then exposes the blue channel. This is added to the Green exposure lost and the Reflection exposure lost.

**Blur Amount** (Thousandths of image width): The light reflection is blurry by virtue of being out of focus and by being diffused by the film base and anti-halation layer. This control represents the width of the applied blur.

**Halation Gamma**: The halation color is first raised to this power before being added to the image. This allows for creative control over the effect of halation on the tonal range of the image, though it's not physically motivated.

**Show only halation**: Enabling this checkbox shows what is added (IE arithmetic addition) to the image.

**Correct for Red shift**: Because Halation re-exposes the red channel first, it will make the exposed negative more red than it originally was. Checking this box applies a correction that neutralizes this red shift so the halation effect will only have an effect at the edges. As a colorist would neutralize an image with a red balance, checking this box applies that correction in-line.

**Blur Type** [NONE, BOX BLUR, TRIANGLE BLUR, FAST BLUR]: Selects the blurring method. None will not apply any blur to the reflected image, Box Blur applies a square convolution of uniform weights, Triangle blur applies a center-weighted blurring with linear falloff, and Fast Blur is essentially a box blur that samples 9 points along the center and perimeter of a square, resulting in great runtime. Box and Triangle blur will run slower with larger blur amounts.



## Invert
Inverts the values in an image.

### DCTL Parameters
**Log Mode**: When checked, computes the inverse by taking `1 - x`. When unchecked, assumes the image is scene linear and therefore computes `1 / x`.

## Lens Distortion DCTL
Applies a basic lens distortion model.

### DCTL Parameters
**Distortion Parameter k**: Chooses the value of $k$ in $r_u = r_d (1 + k r_d^2)$, the model.

## Levels Converter
Converts between full and (0-1023) legal levels (64-940)

### DCTL Parameters
**Mode**: Indicates whether to convert to Legal or to Full levels (the direction of the transform)

**Clip**: Indicates whether to clip extreme values. If Mode is set to `Full to Legal`, then Clip will clip values outside of the range 64-940. Otherwise, clip will clip values outside of the range 0-1023.


## Log Function
For each pixel and channel, takes the logarithm.

### DCTL Parameters
**Log Base**: The base of the logarithm, 10.0 by default.


## Log Curve
Applies the Linear To Log function or Log To Linear function generated by [this repo](https://github.com/thatcherfreeman/log2lin-finder)

### DCTL Parameters
**Base, Offset, Scale, Slope, Intercept, Cut**: These are plugged into the functions:
```
def log2linear(x):
    if (t > cut):
        return scale * pow(base, x) + offset
    else:
        return slope * x + intercept

def linear2log(y):
    if (y > slope * cut + intercept):
        return log((y - offset) / scale) / log(base)
    else:
        return (y - intercept) / slope
```

**Linear Gain**: This applies an exposure correction to the resulting image. If you're running Log2Lin, then the linear image is multiplied by this value. If you're running Lin2Log, then the linear image is divided by this value.

**Direction**: This allows you to specify whether to convert Log to Linear, or Linear to Log.


## Luminance
Given a color gamut, compute the luminance channel associated with those primaries (IE the Y channel after converting to CIE XYZ). Expects the image to be in a Linear state.

### DCTL Parameters
**Color Gamut**: Select a pre-configured color gamut, or choose Custom. If Custom is selected, then the _x,y_ parameters are used to specify the gamut.

**Red/Green/Blue/White x/y**: CIEXYZ _xy_ chromaticity coordinates of the four primary values.

**Show Luminance Vector**: If checked, just outputs the RGB weights of the generated luminance vector, you can take the dot product of this color and your input color to compute the luminance.


## Matrix Tester
Multiplies the RGB values of the input by a 3x3 matrix with the specified entries. Supports negative values.


## Power Function
Computes the function $\texttt{base}^x$.

### DCTL Parameters
**Base** The base of the exponent, raised to the power of the input pixel.


## MTF Curve DCTL
Gives you control over a MTF-like curve. Internally makes passes of different frequencies which can be increased or reduced in gain before combining them back together. Highly recommend using the Quotient method and feeding this DCTL a log image.

### DCTL Parameters
**Band 16-1:1 Contrast**: Applies a gain to the information captured only by this band. Set to 0 to soften the image and raise up to 2 to increase sharpness. The bands are relative to the timeline resolution, with a 16:1 blur, 8:1 blur, 4:1 blur, and 2:1 blur.

**Debug Band**: Specifies which band is viewed when the Debug Mode isn't None.

**Debug Mode**: This pull-down allows you to figure out what each band targets. You can choose from None (runs the plugin normally), Low Pass Mode (shows you the information that's too low frequency to be captured in this band), High Pass Mode (shows the information that's in this band), and High Pass Gray Mode (Same as High Pass mode, but normalized to 0.5 so that the frequency data in this band is more visible).

**Method**: Allows you to choose between Quotient and Difference, which correspond to different ways to compute the frequency bands. In most real-world scenarios, the Quotient method provides better looking results, but the Difference method performs more accurately on zebra striped test charts. Here's the math:
```
quotient_out := (input_value / low_pass5)^band5_contrast * (low_pass5 / low_pass4)^band4_contrast * ... * low_pass1
difference_out := (input_value - low_pass5)*band5_contrast + (low_pass5 - low_pass4)*band4_contrast + ... + low_pass1
```


## Multiplication Function DCTL
Multiplies each channel by a value. The channels are computed by $\text{Red}_{\text{out}} = \text{Red}_{\text{in}} * \text{Global Gain} + \text{Red Gain}$ and likewise for the other two channels.


## Print
Skews the RGB cube so that CMY colors are brighter and more saturated than the RGB colors.

### DCTL Parameters
**Primary Value**: Indicates what value 100% red, green, or blue should be mapped to. IE `f(1, 0, 0) = (primary_value, 0, 0)`

**Secondary Gain**: Indicates how much brighter/saturated the CMY colors should be than their RGB counterparts. Loosely speaking, `f(1, 1, 0)` is proportional to `secondary_gain * (f(1, 0, 0) + f(0, 1, 0))`



## Quantize
Simulates the effect of saving the current image at a specified bit depth.

### DCTL Parameters
**Bit Depth**: The number of bits to be used to represent the current 0->1 value.

**Clip**: Specifies whether to clip values greater than 1.0 or less than 0.0.

**Quantization Method** [ROUND, TRUNCATE]: If set to Round, round each value to the nearest code value, if set to truncate, simply round down to the nearest below code value.



## Random Channel Mixer
Constructs a random RGB matrix that is some distance away from the Identity matrix. Useful when trying out lots of different looks, expects image to be converted to Linear before using.

### DCTL Parameters
**Eps**: Maximum acceptable entry-delta from the identity matrix. Essentially controls the intensity of the applied effect. In some cases, a value about 0.33 will result in division by zero errors and numerical instability when rows are rescaled.

**Seed**: Indicates the random seed used to construct the matrix. Handy if you want to remember the value for later and reproduce a certain look.

**Maintain White**: If checked, scales each row of the RGB matrix to each sum to 1. This helps keep grays neutral in the final result. If unchecked, the image can take on a tint, with luminance maintained by scaling the entire matrix to sum to 3 (but individual rows can sum to values other than 1).

**Show Matrix** [OFF, FLOAT VALUE, SCALED TEN BIT VALUE]: If set to "Float Value", the entries of the matrix are displayed, allowing you to copy the values down using the RGB picker in Fusion. If set to "Scaled Ten Bit Value", the entries of the matrix are displayed, and if you have a 10-bit color picker, the difference between the code value and 500 represents the hundreths of a point that you should enter in the corresponding entry in the RGB Mixer. IE if the top middle patch has a 10-bit code value of `496`, you would enter `-0.04` for the Green channel in the Red Output section of the RGB Mixer.



## Random Contrast Curve
Constructs a contrast curve, has the option to procedurally generate one with random parameters so you can try lots of different curves in a moment.

### DCTL Parameters
**Pivot**: Specify the pivot point, which will remain unchanged in color and value.

**Toe**: Indicates what distance from the pivot to start rolling off the shadows. 0.0 is at the pivot point, 1.0 is near the black point.

**Shoulder**: Indicates what distance from the pivot to start rolling off the highlights. 0.0 is at the pivot point, 1.0 is near the white point.

**Black Point**: Specifies the minimum value in the image.

**White Point**: Specifies the maximum value in the image.

**Pivot Slope**: Specifies the slope of the curve when measured at the pivot point.

**Seed**: Random seed, only used if Randomize box is checked.

**Show Curve**: Check this box to get a graphical display of the curve. Within the gridded area, the x-axis goes from 0.0 to 1.0, negative values are shown to the left and right of the display.

**Randomize**: Check this box to randomly select parameters for the curve (excluding pivot).

**Ungroup RGB**: When checked, if Randomize is also checked, then this will randomize a contrast curve for each of the RGB channels.


## RGB Chips
Creates three columns of RGB chips, and optionally CMY and Luminance chips. When the RGB mixer (or any other operation) is used, the extent to which channels have been mixed will be visible in the RGB Parade. Outputs a Linear image.

### DCTL Parameters
**Number of Steps**: Number of different luminances to display for each chip. Each chip is one stop apart (in linear).

**Exposure**: Amount of gain to be applied to the image, in stops.

**Show RGB Colors**: Displays Red, Green, and Blue charts.

**Show CMY Colors**: Displays Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow charts.

**Show Luminance**: Displays an additionall luminance chart.


## RGB Linear Contrast DCTL
Applies a power function to the RGB channels, keeping 0.18 unchanged. This DCTL expects a scene linear image.

### How it works
The DCTL works in three steps:
1. Apply gain to shift Middle gray to 1.0
2. Raise the code values to the power of `Neutral Gamma * Color Gamma` if Ungroup RGB is checked, otherwise `Neutral Gamma`
3. Revert the gain done in step 1 (divide by that scaling rather than multiply)

### DCTL Parameters
**Red Gamma**: Gamma to be applied only to the Red Channel (if Ungroup RGB is checked)

**Green Gamma**: Gamma to be applied only to the Green Channel (if Ungroup RGB is checked)

**Blue Gamma**: Gamma to be applied only to the Blue Channel (if Ungroup RGB is checked)

**Neutral Gamma**: Gamma applied to all channels, regardless of Ungroup RGB

**Mid Gray**: Specifies the middle gray code value.

**Ungroup RGB**: If unchecked, only applies the Neutral Gamma, otherwise applies both Neutral gamma and the Color Gamma, multiplying together those two powers.


## Safety Lines DCTL
DCTL that creates a white frame to indicate safety boundaries for the image.

### DCTL Parameters
**Aspect Ratio**: Specify the Width to Height ratio for the drawn rectangle.

**Scale**: Size of the box, if the specified aspect ratio is wider than the frame, then 1.0 means that the width will be matched. If the specified aspect ratio is narrower than the frame, then 1.0 means that the height will be matched. Smaller values indicate a smaller drawn box.

**Alpha**: Opacity of the drawn lines.

**Line Thickness**: Thickness of the drawn box.

**Shade Darkness**: Indicates brightness of the region outside of the box.



## Saturation Adjustment DCTL
DCTL that applies Gain and Gamma controls to the Saturation of an image. Can be used in HSL saturation or HSV saturation, though note that in HSL, be sure that inputs are between 0 and 1, as saturation is poorly defined for RGB values outside of this range. This is similar to a combination of the Color Boost (which is approximately a combination of saturation gamma + gain) and Saturation (gain) controls.

### How it works
This DCTL converts the input image to HSL or HSV, then applies a Gamma and Gain adjustment to the result. Then, it converts the image back into RGB. This formulation allows for precise control over the Sat v Sat curve, while only allowing for a nondecreasing response. IE, in Resolve's standard Sat v Sat curve, you can make the mistake of having highly saturated objects in the scene become less saturated than less saturated objects, which will typically look unnatural.

### DCTL Parameters
**Saturation Type**: Specify one of [HSL, HSV]. This converts the RGB image to HSL or HSV space depending on what is specified, and uses the saturation channel from that image. HSV will typically perform better when your input image has luminances greater than 1, but HSL will sometimes make more appealing saturation adjustments.

**Gain**: The input saturation is linearly multiplied by the Gain, so this will adjust the maximum saturation allowed in the image.

**Gamma**: This mimics the Gamma control in Resolve's Primaries wheels, applying a power function to the saturation channel. This is applied before Gain.

**Show Saturation**: This checkbox allows you to view just the saturation channel, after the Gain and Gamma adjustments have been made.

**Show Curve**: When checked, this displays the corresponding curves adjustment that's being made to the saturation channel.


## Sigmoid Function DCTL
Applies the sigmoid function to the inputs. Computes $b + (w-b)\frac{1}{1 + e^{-c(x-d)}}$.

### DCTL Parameters
**X Midpoint**: Controls the value of $d$. Vanilla sigmoid has this set to 0.0.

**Contrast**: Controls the value of $c$. Vanilla sigmoid has this set to 1.0.

**Output White**: Controls the value of $w$. Vanilla sigmoid has this set to 1.0.

**Output Black**: Controls the value of $b$. Vanilla sigmoid has this set to 1.0.


## Softmax DCTL
Applies a Softmax function, with Temperature. Outputs in the 0-1 range for all real inputs.

### DCTL Parameters
**Temperature**: Scales the input values, so larger values will result in a more extreme output.


## Spherical Color Space DCTL
Converts between RGB and a spherical color space. Outputs a 3-channel image, $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$. $\rho$ represents the radius, $\theta$ is scaled 0-1 and represents the hue, and $\phi$ represents saturation and is scaled from 0 to $\pi / 2$.

### DCTL Parameters
**Invert**: When unchecked, converts from RGB to spherical, and when checked, converts from spherical to RGB.


## Subtractive Saturation DCTL
Computes saturation in a way that adds "density" to more saturated colors, making them darker.

### How it works
Suppose a pixel is a color `input`. The DCTL will first compute a `Value` (IE luminance) of that pixel using one of many methods, and from there it can compute the input's `Color` by taking `input / Value`. The color is saturated or desaturated using the Gamma controls (we raise each channel of the `Color` to a power). From there, we multiply the `Color` by a different luminance called `Density` that's calculated using the method specified by the second dropdown menu. The result is scaled so that white is preserved.

### DCTL Parameters
**Color Gamma**: Controls the saturation of the image.

**Cyan Gamma**: Saturation slider that's combined with the Color Gamma slider, moving this to the right will make the image more cyan.

**Magenta Gamma**: Similar to Cyan Gamma slider.

**Yellow Gamma**: Similar to Cyan Gamma slider.

**Density**: Allows you to control how much density is added, on a scale of 0 (`Density` is computed using the same method as `Value`), to 1 (`Density` is computed using the specified method). The floating scale effectively lets you choose the strength of the specified method.

**Value Calculation**: Allows you to select how the `Value` is computed. I don't recommend the Max or Min methods, and you should generally choose a method that runs large (Arithmetic Mean, Geometric Mean, and L2 Norm are recommended).

**Density Calculation**: Allows you to choose how the `Density` is computed. Again, I don't recommend the Max or Min methods, and you should choose a method that runs small (Harmonic Mean is recommended.)


## Tanh Function DCTL
Computes a tanh of the input via $g \tanh(c (x - b))$.

### DCTL Parameters
**Horizontal Offset**: Controls the value of $b$. Vanilla tanh has this set to 0.0.

**Contrast**: Controls the value of $c$. Vanilla tanh has this set to 1.0.

**Output White**: Controls the value of $g$. Vanilla tanh has this set to 1.0.

**Maintain Contrast**: If checked, then the Contrast control controls the derivative at x=0 even if the output white is changed (IE $c$ is scaled by $1/g$).


## T-Log Curve
Converts between linear and my super cool, fully-logarithmic curve. Spec for this curve is 18% gray maps to 50 IRE, then 100% IRE is middle gray plus `num_stops/2`, and 0% is middle gray minus `num_stops/2`. Every stop of dynamic range has an equal number of code values given by `100% / num_stops`. Also clamps the linear input to be >= 0.0 to avoid NaNs.

### DCTL Parameters
**Stops of Dynamic Range**: Indicates the value of `num_stops`, number of stops between 100% and 0%.

**Exposure Compensation**: Applies this many stops of gain prior to a lin2log conversion, and removes this many stops of gain after a log2lin conversion. Convenient if you want to map a tone other than 18% gray to 50IRE, but typically you should leave this at 0.

**Direction**: Indicates whether to convert linear to tlog, or from tlog to linear.


## Unit Length DCTL
Takes the current `(r, g, b)` color value, computes the L2 norm, and divides each component by the norm to convert the vector to unit length.

## Vector Norm DCTL
Computes various norms of the given vector.

### DCTL Parameters
**Norm Type**: Choose between `L1 Norm, L2 Norm, Lp Norm, Maximum, Minimum, Arithmetic Mean, Geometric Mean, Harmonic Mean` to choose the norm type.

**P-Norm Power**: If `Lp Norm` is selected for the norm type, this selects the value of `p`. Lp norm is computed by $(\lvert r \rvert^p + \lvert g \rvert^p + \lvert b \rvert^p)^{1/p}$, and L1 and L2 norm are special cases of this.


## Vignette DCTL
Corrects for a vignette in the image, only handles circular vignettes for now, expects a scene linear image.

### DCTL Parameters
**Vignette Amount**: Uses a model of `1 + ar^2` to determine the amount of vignetting, then multiplies to vignette the image. Vignette amount controls the value of `a`.

**Show Vignette**: If checked, outputs the image that is multiplied by the source image.


## Waveform Guides
Adds a border to the image and draws on the border so that the luma waveform has a luminance scale drawn on it. Put this **after** your ODT.

### DCTL Parameters
**Minor Line Width**: Indicates how wide the narrow dashes on the left side of the waveform are.

**Line Thickness**: How wide you want the lines on the waveform to appear.

**Text Size**: Height of characters written on the left margin.

**Margin for Text**: How much horizontal space is allocated to the characters on the left margin

**Graticule Brightness**: Allows you to increase the brightness of the drawn graticule by repeating the drawn lines and characters.

**BT1886 White Point**: If BT.1886 Annex 1 is selected as the Waveform scale, this controls the white point parameter, specified by $L_W$ in the official recommendation.

**BT1886 Black Point**: If BT.1886 Annex 1 is selected as the Waveform scale, this controls the black point parameter, specified by $L_B$ in the official recommendation. If set to 0, then this is effectively just a gamma function.

**BT1886 Gamma**: Specifies the gamma curve, the recommendation says to fix this at 2.4.

**Rescale Mode**: Choose from None, Fill, or Aspect. As the drawn stuff in the margins changes the remaining space in the viewer, this chooses whether to just crop in on the iamge (None), to scale the image to fill the remaining space (Fill), or to scale the image while preserving its aspect ratio.

**Waveform Scale**: Choose how the horizontal guides in the waveform are calculated. If Gamma2.4 is selected, it's equivalent to BT.1886 Annex 1 with $L_W = 100$, $L_B = 0.0$, and $\gamma = 2.4$.
